# Social Network API
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

  ## Description
  This project is a NoSQL Social Network API built using MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and manage a friend list. The API includes models for User, Thought, and Reaction (as a subdocument of Thought). Users can create, update, and delete thoughts, as well as add or remove reactions. The project is tested using Postman, and a walkthrough video will demonstrate its functionality.

  ## Usage
  Ensure MongoDB is running locally or you can update the connection string to your choosing. The API will then be live on 3001 or your specified port. Use Insomnia or Postman to test the endpoints. If at any point you run into troubles, ensure to locate and watch the walkthrough video that demonstrates how to leverage the routes.
